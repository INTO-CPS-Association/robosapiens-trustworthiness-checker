# Introduction

Welcome to the **RoboSAPIENS Trustworthiness Checker** documentation!

This project provides a runtime monitoring system for robotic systems, with support for multiple communication protocols including MQTT and ROS2. It enables real-time verification of system properties using Lola specifications.

## About

The work presented here is supported by the **RoboSAPIENS project** funded by the European Commission's Horizon Europe programme under grant agreement number 101133807.

## Key Features

- **MQTT Integration**: Monitor and verify properties using MQTT topics as input/output streams
- **ROS2 Support**: Native integration with ROS2 for robotics applications
- **Distributed Monitoring**: Run monitors across multiple nodes in a distributed system
- **Lola Specifications**: Express temporal properties using the Lola stream-based specification language
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Evaluate specifications in real-time as events occur

## What You'll Learn

This documentation will guide you through:

- Setting up and installing the trustworthiness checker
- Writing your first DynSRV specifications
- Integrating with MQTT and ROS2 systems
- Deploying distributed monitors across multiple nodes
- Advanced configuration and customization options
